## About

[SoundMoose](http://www.soundmoose.com) is a non-commercial music platform where you can listen to and discover new music. Create an account to access saved playlists, add tracks to your favorites, and play a "Guess the song" game with your friends!

Our code is based on TypeScript, Angular 2, nrgx/store, Ruby, and Django. For audio and animations, we use Web Audio API and ThreeJS.

All source code is available under the MIT license.

Many thanks to Last.fm, YouTube, Spotify, and SoundCloud for generously providing us with API access!
